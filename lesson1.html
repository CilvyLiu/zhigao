// Lyrics text
const lyricsText = `
I pack my luggage, check my baggage
Prepare my passport, visit the embassy
Apply for a visa, wait for authority
The ministry, the administration, issue guidance for me

Exit through the door, entry to the skies
A journey, a voyage, a trip I can't disguise
Reserve an inn, a dormitory, or a residence
Every accommodation holds a warm presence

Travel, travel, on a scenic way
Marvelous sights greet each day
Picturesque cathedrals, galleries, museums
Fascinating attractions, heritage in bloom
Pleasant and attractive, marvelous and bright
Traveling light, hearts take flight tonight

Escalator or elevator, up to the lobby
Reception smiles, laundry done promptly
Departure calls, we check and we roam
Each destination feels like home

Souvenirs in hand, memories to keep
A tour, a journey, a voyage so deep
Vacation moments, fascinating and free
Every marvel a story, for you and me

Travel, travel, on a scenic way
Marvelous sights greet each day
Picturesque cathedrals, galleries, museums
Fascinating attractions, heritage in bloom
Pleasant and attractive, marvelous and bright
Traveling light, hearts take flight tonight

Prepare for the unknown, every trip's a delight
Authority and security, guiding us right
From agency to inn, through every check
Our voyage is a song we won't forget

Travel, travel, on a scenic way
Marvelous sights greet each day
Picturesque cathedrals, galleries, museums
Fascinating attractions, heritage in bloom
Pleasant and attractive, marvelous and bright
Traveling light, hearts take flight tonight

Travel light, carry love, not just baggage
Each journey, each trip, turns into a passage
From magnificent views to memories we store
Travel, voyage, adventure, forevermore
